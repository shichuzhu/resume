\section{TEACHING EXPERIENCE}
{\bf Teaching Assistant}, University of Illinois \righttime{Fall 2016 -- Spring 2017}\\
Fall 2016 ATMS 301 TA with Prof. \!Sonia Lasher-Trapp and Spring 2017 ATMS 201 with Prof. Eric Snodgrass. Activities included grading, writing quiz questions and giving mini lectures explaining homework problems.

\section{RESEARCH EXPERIENCE}
{\bf Research Assistant}, University of Illinois \righttime{Aug. 2014 -- May. 2016}\\
Statistically analyzed the vast radar data and images of ice particles collected during the High Altitude Ice Crystals -- High Ice Water Content (HAIC -- HIWC) field campaign. The results were used to improve the accuracy of cloud formation in the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model. The project was advised by Prof. \!Greg McFarquhar and funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The results were presented in multiple conferences.

{\bf Visiting Student}, National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) \righttime{Aug. 2015 -- Aug. 2016}\\
Compared performance and results of the softwares from NCAR and Univ. of Illinois, which were used to process the raw pixel image of ice particles and produce the size distribution. Improved the performance of Illinois' version and corrected a few bugs, in addition to comparing the results due to different image processing algorithms.

{\bf Undergraduate Thesis}, Peking University \righttime{Sept. 2013 -- Jun. 2014}\\
Tested multiple numerical schemes to solve the advection equation, among which the Flux-corrected Transport method (FCT) serves as a candidate to model the water vapor transportation to be implemented in the General Circulation Model (GCM) developed by the research group of Prof. Xinyu Wen.

{\bf Visiting Student}, California Institute of Technology \righttime{Jul. 2013 -- Sept. 2013}\\
Performed numerical simulation of equatorial super-rotation and high latitude jet structure of Jupiter's weather layer using a shallow-water model with varying parameterized convection. The research was directed by Prof.\! Andrew P. Ingersoll from the Division of Geological and Planetary Science.

{\bf Undergraduate Research}, Peking University \righttime{Fall 2011 -- Fall 2013}\\
Integrated simulation and observational data to study the seasonal change of the Hadley Circulation under El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na scenarios. The research was funded by the \emph{The Chun-Tsung Scholar Fund for Undergraduate Research of Peking University} and supervised by Prof.\! Yongyun Hu.
